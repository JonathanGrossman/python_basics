# List Comprehension

# list comprehension is a Python way for looping through iterables
# comprehension in Python is like for loops but with more compact syntax
resulting_list = [expression for element in list (optional condition)]
# expression is any valid expression that returns a value
# element is the object or value in the list
# list is an iterable; comprehension works on any other iterable, such as a dict, set, sequence, generator, or any other iterable object
# optional condition used to filter what ends up in the resulting list


# populate a list using comprehension instead of a for loop or map()
# filter using list comprehension so that only elements meeting the defined criteria are added to the resulting list
# use conditional logic in your comprehension
# be careful not to overuse or to over-nest list comprehension because it can result in code that is difficult to read / understand
# if you need something more complicated than the examples, you should consider whether a for loop is easier to read
