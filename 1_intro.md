## What is Python


```
# an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language used for many purposes, such as web development, game development, machine learning  and artificial intelligence, data science and visualization, web scraping, and more

# has built-in data structures and dynamic typing

# emphasizes readability 

# like JavaScript, Python allows you to use simple functions and variables in addition to object-oriented programming 

# Python allows developers to import code into a project in the form of modules and packages

# modules and packages are pre-written code (by you or others) that you can incorporate into your project

# using modules and packages saves you time and resources by providing functionality that you don’t have to write the code for

# you can find modules and packages using Python’s Package Index

# PIP is the recommended Python package manager, useful for installing, upgrading, and removing packages (and more)

# Zen of Python (import this); some of the guiding principles

      Beautiful is better than ugly.
      Explicit is better than implicit.
      Simple is better than complex.
      Complex is better than complicated.
      Flat is better than nested.
      Sparse is better than dense.
      Readability counts.
      Errors should never pass silently.
      Unless explicitly silenced.
      If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
      Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
