# What is Python

Python is a very versatile, popular, and powerful progamming language. Among many other things, people build Python projects such as web applications, robots, games, and machine learning solutions. Getting started learning Python is easy. With the right focus and documentation, you can learn the basics of Python online or at a Python bootcamp. Before you know it, you can build real-world solutions that you and others rely upon in your daily life. To help jumpstart your imagination, here is some dicussion of what you can build with Python.

### Web Applications

Build Python web applications that users interact with online. For instance, many people use Python to build blogs, content management systems, and virtual classrooms. With Python web frameworks like Flask and Django, and with the countless libraries and packages to support Python web development, building a web application using Python is possible for beginners and experts alike. 

In simple terms, you write your server in Python code. Then, for a frontend, you have several options. For instance, you can write it using Flask's or Django's built-in frontend templating engines. Or you can build your frontend in a separate application (like vanilla JavaScript, React, Angular, or Vue) that communicates with your server like a microservice. 

For a database, you can choose between SQL, no-SQL, and third-party services that work like databases (like Google Docs, Google Sheets, and other services). Flask and Django ship with built-in SQL capabilities. Though helpful third-party libraries exist for interacting with no-SQL options, like MongoDB and Google Firebase.

By building your web application using Python, your web application may more easily interact with other Python projects, like machine learning and robotics.

### Social Media (Bots and Streaming)

Build Python applications that interact with users on social media. For instance, build a Twitter bot that tweets, retweets, likes messages, and follows users based on a pre-set schedule. This can be a great way to automate some of the ways you engage with your audience. It is not just Twitter you can automate. You can write Python bots for Instagram, Facebook, Discord, Telegram, and more. A real project I built is a weather station that Tweets the humidity and temperature readings from a Raspberry Pi and also provides the weather information on-demand from Telegram.

You also can write Python projects that livestream video. For instance, livestream to Facebook, YouTube Live, Periscope, and Twitch. By creating a Python application that assists you with livestreaming your content, you can interact with your audience in more effective ways.

To make a bot or to livestream, you write a Python script and connect it to the API for the social media platform of your choice. Plenty of third-party packages and tutorials are online for making Python bots and for livestreaming. You can even connect your Python script to a web application or automate it using crontab or some other scheduler.

### Game Development

Build games using Python. For instance, build games that slide across the screen and serve hours of entertainment to its users. Build classic games like solitaire, pong, and tic-tac-toe. Or build educational games that engage students in exciting ways. Teach students how to read, calculate math, or write programs! Several Python packages are available for building games.

Two popular Python gaming packages ar named PyGame and PyArcade. You can build full-featured video games using PyGame or PyArcade. They are free to use and have a lot of downloads. Plus, both PyGame and PyArcade have many helpful tutorials and documentation online to help get you started and to inspire your next great game.

### Internet of Things and Robotics

Write software that controls hardware. Python one of the most popular languages for writing software for the Raspberry Pi and other microcontrollers. Build robots, weather stations, and home automation hardware that run on Python software. For instance, build a miniature car that follows a line drawn on the floor. Build a weather station that monitors your garden. Build a motion-activated security camera that emails you when it detects movement.

Three of the most popular ways to write Python for IoT and robotics is using the Raspberry Pi, Circuit Python, and MicroPython. The internet has enough documentation and guides to get you started. Beware, however, that merging hardware and software is very addicting! 

### Machine Learning and Data Science




Python is a popular choice for building games, robots, and chatbots. With Python, you can also build graphical user interfaces, applications that convert filenames and sizes, and projects that work with audio, video and text files. One of the newer and more popular areas for writing Python code is machine learning, image processing and data analysis. Although Python has has a reputation for rapid application development and for connecting applications, it is also becoming a go-to solution in general. 


Python is easy to learn and has a syntax that is very easy to read and write. Here is an example. If we want to find out whether a Python list named ```theList``` contains a value of ```79```, and if so, print ```True```, we can simply write the following:

```
theList = [59, 69, 79]

if 79 in theList:
    print(True)

```


```
# an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language used for many purposes, such as web development, game development, machine learning  and artificial intelligence, data science and visualization, web scraping, and more

# has built-in data structures and dynamic typing

# emphasizes readability 

# like JavaScript, Python allows you to use simple functions and variables in addition to object-oriented programming 

# Python allows developers to import code into a project in the form of modules and packages

# modules and packages are pre-written code (by you or others) that you can incorporate into your project

# using modules and packages saves you time and resources by providing functionality that you don’t have to write the code for

# you can find modules and packages using Python’s Package Index

# PIP is the recommended Python package manager, useful for installing, upgrading, and removing packages (and more)

# Zen of Python (import this); some of the guiding principles

      Beautiful is better than ugly.
      Explicit is better than implicit.
      Simple is better than complex.
      Complex is better than complicated.
      Flat is better than nested.
      Sparse is better than dense.
      Readability counts.
      Errors should never pass silently.
      Unless explicitly silenced.
      If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
      Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
