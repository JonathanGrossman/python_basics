# Comments  

### Comments are code that the computer does not run.  


### Why do developers leave comments in their code?  


Comments help explain to people who read the code what the code does and why it’s important.  

Comments are important when reading code that other people wrote and when reading code you wrote a long time ago. 

Writing comments in pseudocode can help you plan before writing the actual code. 


### How do you turn code into a comment?    


#### Highlight the text and press  

> Command + / (Mac)  


> Control + / (Windows)  

### Example of a comment (the comment is denoted by #):  

```python
# x is an integer (this is a comment)
x = 3
```

#### Note: don’t overuse comments  


#### Note: keep comments short
