# Comments  

## Comments are code that the computer does not run.  

### Why do developers leave comments in their code?  

When we write code, we have two main audiences. First, we write code for the computer. We want to write code that the computer understands. If the computer doesn't understand the code, then the program won't run properly or at all. Second, we write code for developers (our future self included). While the code that you write might be self explanatory, especially if you use good names for variables, comments will nonetheless help. Sure, certain blocks of code will be easy to understand without comments. Others, however, will become complex and too difficult to fully comprehend without an unreasonable amount of tinkering. 

By leaving short but meaningful comments, you can explain to people who read the code what the code does and why it’s important. This will decrease the amount of time it takes someone to understand your code and also help make sure they understand it all. Plus, the process of making and updating comments will make you think more about your code, which can lead to more efficient scripts. For instance, before you write the code itself, writing comments in pseudocode can help you plan before writing the actual code.  

Writing comments may seems tedious at first. But once you realize the value of them and how they save you time and frustration, you will begin to incorporate them into your routine. For example, you will write a sophisticated block of code and then not look at it for weeks or months. In the process of maintaining your project or adding to it, you later will come across this complex code and not know what it means at first. If you wrote effective comments when you wrote the code, it should be much easier for you to figure out what the code does and how to work with it. 

## How do you turn code into a comment?    

Highlight the text and press

> Command + / (Mac)  
> Control + / (Windows)  

## Example of a comment (the comment is denoted by #):  

```python
# x is an integer (this is a comment)
x = 3
```

### Notes: 
> don’t overuse comments  
> keep comments short
