# Comments

### coments are code that the computer does not run.

### why do developers user them?

    comments help explain to people who read the code what the code does and why itâ€™s important.
    comments are important when reading code that other people wrote and when reading code you wrote a long time ago
    writing comments in pseudocode can help you plan before writing the actual code
