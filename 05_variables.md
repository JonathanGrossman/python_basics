# Variables

## Examples of variables

You must assign a variable a value before you can use the variable  
```python
j = 10  
print(j)
```


You can change the value of a variable (hence the meaning of “variable”)  
```python
j = 20    
print(j)  
```

You can set variables equal to any data type  
```python
g = "this is a letter"   
print(g)  
```

You can assign a variable to a variable  
```python
j = g    
print(j)
```


You can set multiple variables in one expression  
```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3    
print(a)  
print(b)  
print(c)  
```

If a variable is assigned a value, you can use it
```python
k = 12  
print(k + 1)  
print(k)  
```

If you have not assigned a value to a variable, you can't use it  
```python
k = k + 1  
print(k)  
```

None is a value  
```python
print(type(None))  
```
